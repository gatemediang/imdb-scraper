# ðŸŽ¬ IMDb Top 25 Movies Scraper
A simple and efficient Python script that scrapes the titles, release years, and ratings of the top 25 movies from IMDb's chart. The collected data is then saved into a clean CSV file for easy use in data analysis or other projects.

This project is an excellent beginner-friendly example of web scraping using Python's most popular libraries.

### âœ¨ Features

**Polite Scraping:** Uses a User-Agent header to identify the script to the web server.

**Error Handling:** Gracefully skips over any list items that don't match the expected format.

**Structured Output:** Saves the data into a well-formatted imdb_top_25.csv file using the pandas library.
